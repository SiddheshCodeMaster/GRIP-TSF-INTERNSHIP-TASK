# GRIP-TSF-INTERNSHIP-TASK-1

***The Sparks Foundation Internship of Data Science and Business Analytics Tasks.***

***The project is based on Supervised Machine Learning.***

***I had to predict the percentage score recieve by the student when he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.***

***Used supervised machine learning concepts like Linear Regression Modelling.***

***Used Libraries like:*** 
- Numpy Library: For numerical data manipulation in Python.
- Pandas Library: For data frame manipulation in Python.
- Matplotlib Library: For visualizations and graphing in Python.
- Seaborn Library: For advanced visualizations and graphs for the data in Python.
- Scikit-Learn Library: For creation of dummies, models and estimating predictions from the models we create. Also, used for finding errors in Predicted models.

***Achieved 93.67 % accuracy for the model I created. Calculated the mean square error and mean absolute error.***

## Lessons Learned from this Project:

- Understood the difference between unsupervised machine learning and supervised machine learning.
- Documentation using Jupyter Notebook was learnt.
- How  to ask for assistance in project from fellow colleagues was done.
- Understanding of the libraries used for machine learning was done.
